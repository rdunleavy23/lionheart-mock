## 🎯 Conclusion

**Current State:** We have a solid, modern foundation with good UX and design. However, we're missing the **authentic visual content** and **parent-focused tools** that make sites like KinderCare and Bright Horizons best-in-class.

**To Be Best-in-Class:** We need real photos, video content, and functional parent tools (enrollment, availability checker, portal). The design and structure are there—we just need to fill it with authentic content and add the interactive features parents expect.

**Priority:** Focus on replacing placeholders with real content FIRST. That's the biggest trust builder and conversion driver.
